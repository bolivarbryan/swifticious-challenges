/*
 Write a function that accepts a string, and returns how many times a specific character appears,
 taking case into account.
 Tip: If you can solve this without using a for-in loop, you can consider it a Tricky challenge.
 Sample input and output
 • The letter “a” appears twice in “The rain in Spain”.
 • The letter “i” appears four times in “Mississippi”.
 • The letter “i” appears three times in “Hacking with Swift”.
 Hints
 Hint #1: Remember that String and Character are different data types.
 Hint #2: Don’t be afraid to go down the brute force route: looping over characters using a for-
 in loop.
 Hint #3: You could solve this functionally using reduce(), but tread carefully.
 Hint #4: You could solve this using NSCountedSet, but I’d be suspicious unless you could justify the extra overhead.
