 Write a solution for finding the lest amount of changes you need for making an array of ones an zeroes itermitents:
 - example 1: [1, 1, 0] = 1, here you only need to change the first item to make it itermitent
 - example 2: [1, 1, 0, 0] = 2, here you need to change the first and fourth items to make this array itermitent
 - example 3: [1, 1, 1, 0] = 1, here you need to change the second item to make this array itermitent
 - example 4: [0, 1, 0] = 0, no changes are needed here
